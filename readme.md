# Create shell for matrix molds

Create a shell which can be used with your master to create a glove. Note that this only works with items that are designed to be poured facing downwards.

## Installation

Download the repo from the [releases](https://github.com/TristanMcLaughlin/3d-glove-mold/releases) section.

Open Blender, and navigate to Edit- > Preferences

Go to Add-ons and click 'Install'. Locate the downloaded zip file and check the box to activate the addon.

## Usage
Once installed and activated, navigate to the 3D view and select an object. It is best to center the object on the XY planes, and have the Z resting where you want the base of the object to be.

Navigate to the right sidebar and click 'Tool', then you will see at the bottom a new panel titled 'Create glove mold panel' has been added.

Select your object, then click 'Create Cone' to create the funnel for the glove mold. This will be placed at the top of your model. Move and resize the cone as desired, then set your glove mold thickness and shell thickness. Then select your original object and hit 'Create glove mold for selected object'.
